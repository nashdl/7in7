Accessing files with the code block form of File.open results in the io object being closed automatically at the end of the code block.

Hash has h.to_a while Array does not have a.to_hash.
For to_hash you could do:
h = {}
a.each_index do |i|
  h[i.to_s] = a[i]
end



i = 1
a = []
while i <= 16 do
  a.push i
  i = i + 1
end

a.each do |e|
  n = a.index(e)
  puts n
  if n % 4 do
    puts e
  end
end
